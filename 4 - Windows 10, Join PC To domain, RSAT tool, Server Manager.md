# Windows 10, Join PC To domain, RSAT tool, Server Manager

## Description
In this lab, I extended the virtual lab by installing a Windows 10 virtual machine and joining it to the previously created `lycatech.com` domain. This step demonstrates practical skills essential for help desk and desktop support roles, such as domain joining, IP configuration, enabling administrative accounts, and installing Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) on Windows 10.

The goal of this lab is to simulate a real-world environment where help desk technicians manage users, troubleshoot domain-related issues, and access Active Directory from client machines without logging directly into the domain controller.

## Lab Environment

- **Platform**: Oracle VirtualBox  
- **Domain Controller**: Windows Server 2016 (`lycatech.com`)  
- **Client Machine**: Windows 10 Pro  
- **Tools & Software**:
  - RSAT Tools (Active Directory, Group Policy, DHCP, DNS)
  - Chrome and TeamViewer (optional utilities)
  - Static IP configuration for isolated lab networking
